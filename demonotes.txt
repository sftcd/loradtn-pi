- Runs on startup
- Self shutdown
- Relative sleep
- Different sleep patterns eg. Greedy 
- Simulated voltage

-- Run first script manually that starts at high voltage and
-- depletes to low voltage (in eg. 2 minutes) such that pi decides to sleep -> show display before sleep

-- After reboot, demonstrate relative sleep (eg. 2 min on 2 min off)

-- Enable startup script after second reboot ?

-- ? How to demonstrate low power state ? 

-- Show battery log, snapshot file - display time is in local time, log time is UTC

-- Cron job for pushing log file
