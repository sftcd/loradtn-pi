# Building the node...

This'll maybe evolve into a larger build guide, but we'll start where
we start...

- We're using a new [solar charge controller](http://www.allpowers.net/index.php?c=product&id=109)
- We'll likely use a USB GSM backhaul
- We may well use the Pi WiFi as a client and the maintainer's laptop as an AP 

# Getting the Pi/Witty-Pi setup...

- WittyPi-2 [user guide](http://www.uugear.com/doc/WittyPi2_UserManual.pdf)
- That says to not use NOOBS but to rather [directly install the OS](https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/README.md)

Next up... do the Pi/WittyPi install...
